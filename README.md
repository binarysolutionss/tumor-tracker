A machine learning-powered web application for melanoma skin cancer detection using deep learning and computer vision.

## Overview

TumorTracker is a Flask-based web application that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze images of skin lesions and detect potential melanoma. The system provides real-time analysis with confidence scores and recommended actions based on the detection results.

## Features

-Real-time image processing and analysis
-Deep learning-based melanoma detection
-Confidence score reporting
-Custom recommendations based on detection results
-User-friendly web interface
-Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)

## Technology Stack

Backend Framework: Flask (Pyhthon)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Image Processing: PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Deep Learning Model: Custom CNN Architecture

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:

3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
MaxPooling layers
Flatten layer
Dense layers with dropout for regularization
Binary classification output

## Installation

Download melanoma test data images
"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images"

## Clone the repository:

bashCopygit clone [repository-url]

## Install required dependencies:

Flask
Tensorflow
numpy

## Run the application:

bashCopypython app.py
Usage

Navigate to the web interface (default: http://localhost:5000)
Upload an image of the skin lesion
Click "Upload" to process the image
View the detection results and recommendations

## Training the Model
To train the model with your own dataset:

Organize your dataset in the following structure:

Copydata/melanoma/
├── train/
│   ├── benign/
│   └── malignant/
└── test/
    ├── benign/
    └── malignant/

## Run the training script:

bashCopypython train_model.py
